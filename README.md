# MolecularUI

MolecularUI is an Unreal Engine plugin that demonstrates how to build a
simple store interface using **CommonUI** and the **ModelViewViewModel**
(MVVM) framework.  It includes a sample subsystem, view models and
widgets that showcase asynchronous data loading and basic interactions.

Compatible with UE 5.6 Lyra (or custom CommonUI setup, though Lyra works out of the box)
